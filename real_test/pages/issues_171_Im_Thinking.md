# “I’m Thinking”\n\n
### by **Dylan Skurka**\n\n
I’m sitting somewhere\n shaded from danger.\n My head is light,\n my heart beats steady,\n my back is upright,\n nestling into feathery\n charcoaled white.\n My arboreal saviour.\n\n
I’m sitting somewhere.\n There are no problems to solve,\n just pure experience to be had.\n I’m not thinking\n as a means to an end,\n as a product to be sold,\n as a prize to be won.\n\n
I’m just thinking to think.\n To open doors slammed shut,\n to let out all the breath built up.\n No more worries of scarcity,\n because even when emptied,\n I am still enough.\n\n
I’m thinking til there’s nothing\n but a blank thought bubble\n hovering above.\n I’m thinking to clear the way,\n to make space\n for the fullness of love.\n\n
