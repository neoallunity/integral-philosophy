## English Abstract

% Moiseev V.I. - English abstract
 Laboratory of Integral Mathematics (directed by A.A. Safonov),
 Laboratory of Integral Ethics (directed by N.A. Podzolkova),
 Laboratory of the Philosophy of Language (directed by E.G. Lugovskaya),
 Laboratory of the Philosophy of History (directed by I.A. Zhubrin).
 Subsequently, projects for the Laboratory of Integral Law (directed by O.M. Kholkin), the Laboratory of Integral Music (also directed by O.M. Kholkin), and the Laboratory of Integral Physics (directed by N.A. Smolyanova) were initiated.
 The activities of the laboratories have gradually acquired more definite form. Proposals for projects and work plans have been submitted, implementation of the plans has commenced, and new participants, including representatives from the younger generation, are being actively recruited.
 The Institute of Integral Science is, first and foremost, a scholarly association, wherein a fundamental conceptual framework for the operations of both the Institute as a whole and its constituent laboratories is essential. The principal objective is the construction of the initial contours of integral scientific knowledge, coordinating deductive (from the general to the particular) and inductive (from the particular to the general) trajectories of inquiry.
 The article provides an overview of a number of areas of work of the Institute of Integral Science (IIS), established as a public association by the Integral Community in January 2025. The principles and possible research topics in such areas as integral mathematics, logic and physics, integral chemistry, biomedicine and psychology, integral ethics, sociology and economics, integral history and linguistics, integral law and integral art, integral spirituality are considered. In each direction, the main problems are highlighted and possible ways of further research within the framework of the IIS are outlined.
