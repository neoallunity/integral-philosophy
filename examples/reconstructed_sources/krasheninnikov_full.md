% Krasheninnikov V.V. - English abstract
 The article employs the method of polar analysis—a key methodological approach of V.I. Moiseev's philosophy of neoallunity—to examine the ethical dynamics of Hellenistic culture, from mythological consciousness to the social philosophy of Socrates. The author regards ancient philosophy as the foundational basis of the Western European cultural paradigm, the study of which becomes particularly relevant in an era of shifting scientific and philosophical paradigms. Polar analysis, a core competency of integral science, is applied here to the material of ancient Greek culture. The central figure of the study is the Hero, whose actions and fate are examined as projections of antinomic concepts onto the vector of synthesis—a key heuristic concept of the proposed cultural model. The analysis encompasses both mythological characters and heroes of Greek tragedies, as well as the founders of Socratic schools, who acted as "heroes of their time."
 Special attention is paid to the dialectic of fate (Moira) and will (Thymos), revealed through the analysis of tragic heroes. Oedipus, attempting to avoid his predestined fate, inadvertently fulfils it, demonstrating the classic irony of destiny. In contrast, Achilles achieves true synthesis by consciously accepting his fate and returning to battle, guided by ideals of honour and duty. These examples illustrate that true heroism lies not in blind submission to fate or destructive rebellion against it, but in conscious alignment with higher ethical principles. A significant portion of the study is devoted to analysing the conflict between individual truth and collective justice, as exemplified in Sophocles' tragedy *Antigone*. The author shows how Antigone, motivated by divine law and familial duty, enters into an irreconcilable conflict with Creon, who defends state order and human law. This conflict, unresolved within the tragedy, finds its resolution in the philosophy of Socrates, who proposes a path of synthesis through dialogue and rational adherence to laws, balancing personal morality with societal values.
 Particularly noteworthy is the author's examination of Hellenistic philosophical schools (Cynicism, Stoicism, Epicureanism, and Scepticism), each of which developed its own path to ethical synthesis. The Cynics, represented by Diogenes of Sinope, sought absolute inner freedom through radical asceticism and the rejection of social conventions. The Stoics, conversely, pursued harmony between individual reason and cosmic order, reflected in their teachings on the Logos and the concept of the "cosmopolis." The Epicureans focused on overcoming fear and insatiability through rational limitation of desires and the cultivation of —tranquillity of the soul. The Sceptics developed a unique method of —suspension of judgement—as a means to achieve mental equilibrium. A key conclusion of the study is the demonstration that polar analysis serves as an effective tool for examining ethical contradictions and their resolutions in ancient philosophy. Of particular significance is the author's finding that the historical figure of Socrates possesses the greatest "synthetic potential," as his life, philosophical method, and even his death represent a unique example of resolving a broad spectrum of ethical antinomies.
 The work opens avenues for further research into the concept of "heroism" across different historical periods up to the present day, which could contribute to deeper studies in the field of integral ethics. The proposed methodological approach holds significant potential for application in contemporary philosophical and ethical research, particularly in addressing the pressing moral challenges of our time.
