\section{Preface}
\label{sec:preface-en}

The present volume marks a significant milestone in the development of integral science as an emerging research paradigm. On 4 January 2025, the Institute of Integral Science (IIS) was established by unanimous decision of the Integral Community as a public association dedicated to the systematic pursuit of knowledge integration across traditionally disparate domains of inquiry.

This collection of articles represents the inaugural scholarly output of the Institute's constituent laboratories, each addressing fundamental questions within their respective fields whilst adhering to shared methodological principles rooted in the philosophy of neoallunity.
